# Decomposition-Calorimetric-Spectra
This code was written as an exercise after the Holliday break 2017 (11 January/2017).
This is a beta version of an automatic fitting and decomposition code
for the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectra into a sum of various types of Gaussian-like peaks. 
Only single data file from ref. [1] paper was used for testing, so it needs more testing.
